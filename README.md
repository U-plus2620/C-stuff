# C-stuff

This repository will G-d willing, be some of my little (or big) C programs that hopefully could help me and anyone else who finds them.
I will try and keep these programs simple and readable.
I am inspired by the "unix philosiphy" and so my programs will try and conform to that philosiphy.
