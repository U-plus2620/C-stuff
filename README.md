# C-stuff

This repository will G-d willing, be some of my little (or big) C programs that hopefully could help me and anyone else who finds them.
I will try and keep these programs simple and readable.
I am inspired by the "unix philosiphy" and so my programs will try and conform to that ideology.

##INSTALATION
Just clone that repo!!

##linked_list.c
In order to use the linked_list.c file you must include the header file as such
`#include "linked_list.h"`
And then use this gcc command assuming that your program is called foo.c,
`gcc foo.c linked_list.c -o <output file>`
